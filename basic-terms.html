        <h1>Basic attack</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Basic_Attack.png" alt=""> One of the first things you learn in league of legends is the basic attack also known as auto attack and is  something that is available to all characters/champions and in most situations cannot be avoided and deals  damage based on your attack damage which can be increased through buying items in the shop.
    </span>
    <span class="stats">
        <h1>Stats</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Stats.png" alt=""> Like most video games in league you have stats these stats range from: Increasing damage dealt with  certain abilites, Taking reduced damage from a certain type, Healing yourself based on damage dealt etc....  What differs from other games is that your stats reset at the start of each match.
    </span>
    <span class="abilites">
        <h1>Abilites</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Abilites.png" alt=""> Abilites , There is a ton of them, Well there are 785 to be exact and each champion gets 5 abilites: a Passive which is an effect that is active at all times ,3 Basic Abilites usually referred to by Q , W and E these differ from  champion to champion and there isnt a concrete forumla for them and last but not least the Ultimate ability of a champion known as R or Ult it's the most powerful ability of a champion and can be used less frequently throughout a match.
    </span>
    <span class="summoner">
        <h1>Summoner Spells</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Summoner.png" alt=""> Summoner spells are active effect that every player get 2 of they usually have high cooldown time ranging  from 180 seconds (3 Minutes) to 300 seconds (5 Minutes) and can easily affect the outcome of a 1 vs 1  or a teamfight on their own 
    </span>
    <span class="level">
        <h1>Levels/Exp</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Level.jpg" alt=""> Like in any video game League Of Legends has levels, Each match you start at LVL 1 you get to rank up a single basic ability (Q,W,E) and you can gain EXP through 3 ways: Champion Takedowns , Killing Jungle Camps and Being near minions when they die, Each LVL you get a small increase to some of your stats and get to rank up a single ability, Q,W,E each have 5 ranks, R has 3 and can only be leveled up at LVLs 6,11,16 and you can't level up your Passive the max LVL of any champion in a match is 18.
    </span>
    <span class="damage">
        <h1>Damage Types</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Damage.jpg" alt=""> There are Currently 4 damage types: 
        <br> <br> 1) Physical damage: which is distinguished by it's orange text this damage type is applied by basics attacks and usually characters based around the attack damage stat although there are some exceptions and is reduced by the armor stat. 

        <br> <br> 2) Magic damage: as the name implies is caused by magical attacks is indicated by its blue/Purplish color and primarly comes from ability hits and certain items and is reduced by the magic resist stat. 

        <br> <br> 3) True damage: True damage is unique in the fact that: It's primarly found on a select few champions and a single item , Goes through armor and magic resist but still can be blocked by shields and is colored white. 

        <br> <br> 4) Execute damage: while this isn't exactly a damage type its present in some Ultimates it's basically a level higher than true damage in the sense that at a certain health threshold it cannot be blocked whatsoever in other words it goes through defense stats shields and does 9999 critical true damage which equates to 9999 million true damage
