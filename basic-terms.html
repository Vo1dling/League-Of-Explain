        <img src="/Images/Basic_Attack.png" alt="">  &nbsp; One of the first things you learn in league of legends is the basic attack also known as auto attack and is <br> &nbsp; something that is available to all characters/champions and in most situations cannot be avoided and deals <br> &nbsp; damage based on your attack damage which can be increased through buying items in the shop
    </span>
    <span class="stats">
        <img src="/Images/Stats.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Like in most video games in league you have stats these stats range from: Increasing damage dealt with <br> &nbsp; certain abilites, Taking reduced damage from a certain type, Healing yourself based on damage dealt etc.... <br> &nbsp; What differs from other games is that your stats reset at the start of each match
