        <h1>Ability Power</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Ability_power.png" alt=""> Ability power also known as AP is a stat that boosts the effects of some items and abilities Those effects receive a bonus proportional to the ability power of the champion. For example, if a champion has 50 ability power and one of their spells deals 100 (+20% AP) damage, the damage of the spell is 110. The spell descriptions in the game do not show that percentage, they show the resulting bonus. The description of the spell in this example would show the damage of the spell as 100 (+10)
        and is the one of the stats that starts at 0 and doesn't increase with level.

    <span class="Attack_Damage">
        <h1>Attack Damage</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Attack_damage.png" alt=""> Attack damage more commonly referred to as AD is the stat that determines the amount of physical damage dealt by basic attacks. AD also determines the damage of various champion abilities and items Total attack damage is comprised of base attack damage and bonus attack damage. The base attack damage is innate to the champion. It does not depend on items or runes and increases with each champion level Bonus attack damage can be gained from items, abilities Increasing the bonus AD is the typical way to scale up the damage output of an AD-based champion.

    <span class="Magic_Resist">
        <h1>Magic Resist</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Magic_resist.png" alt=""> Magic Resistance, Magic Resist or MR is a statistic that reduces incoming magic damage. This stat can be found on all units, including monsters and structures. Each champion begins with some MR and has diminishing returns in other words getting more of it reduces the effectiveness of its scaling for example if a champion had 100 MR they wouldn't gain as much damage reduction as much as if they had 50 MR
    </span>
    <span class="Armor">
        <h1>Armor</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Armor.png" alt=""> Armor is a statistic that reduces incoming physical damage. This stat can be found on all units, including monsters and structures. Each champion begins with some armor which increases with level although there are some exceptions Armor can also be acquired from abilities, items like MR it has diminishing returns.
    </span>
    <span class="Attack_Speed">
        <h1>Attack Speed</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Attack_speed.png" alt=""> Attack speed, AS or ASPD is a stat that is the frequency of a unit's basic attacks. They are measured and displayed as attacks per second Each champion starts with a certain attack speed ratio, which is also the value given by default to their base attack speed (attack speed at level 1 without any other bonuses). Some champions can start with a base attack speed different from their attack speed ratio. Additional bonus attack speed can be obtained through level up or with a variety of items and abilities also Attack speed is capped at 2.5 attacks per second (or 1 attack every 0.4 seconds). It also cannot be reduced below a floor of 0.2 (or 1 attack every 5 seconds). The values of these restrictions can be altered by certain effects.
    </span>
    <span class="Ability_Haste">
        <h1>Ability Haste</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Ability_Haste.png" alt=""> Ability Haste (AH) is a statistic that represents cooldown reduction, particularly cooldown of champion abilities. It is distinct from other versions of haste such as summoner spell haste and item haste, which are not visibly tracked in game The reduced cooldown is determined at the moment an ability is activated. Increasing or decreasing ability haste while the skill is on cooldown will not affect the cooldown this stats has diminishing returns.
    </span>
    <span class="Critcal_Chance">
        <h1>Critcal Chance</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Crit.png" alt=""> Critical strike chance is a statistic that denotes the probability that a basic attack will critically strike, as well as some other effects that use critical strike chance Critical strike chance is not granted naturally by level-ups, it can be increased with items and abilities; it also it cannot be increased beyond 100%, although some effects will benefit from the excess despite the cap The probability of a critical strike changes dynamically based on how many times the attack critically strikes. If an attack does not critically strike over multiple attempts, the probability will progressively increase for future attempts—this can occur vice versa, where multiple successful critical strikes will cause the probability to progressively decrease for future attempts.
    </span>
    <span class="Movement_Speed">
        <h1>Movement Speed</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Movement_speed.png" alt=""> Movement speed is a champion statistic that represents the rate at which a champion travels across a map. One point of movement speed translates to one game distance unit traveled per second Each champion has a collision radius that determines their ability to path around units and for units to path around them. The smaller the collision radius, the easier it is for them for move through units without getting blocked. The collision radius is different from the radius for getting hit by skillshots Each champion begins the game with a base amount of movement speed that ranges from 315 to 355 This base movement speed can be increased by flat bonuses and percentage bonuses and reduced by slows. These effects can come from items, champion abilities and summoner spells.
    </span>
    <span class="Range">
        <h1>Range</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Range.png" alt=""> Each champion begins the game with a particular base basic attack range. This can vary from 125 to 250 for melee units and 300 to 650 for ranged units some passive effects,champion abilites and items allow the player to increase this stat.
    </span>
    <span class="Critcal_Damage">
        <h1>Critcal Damage</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Crit_Damage.png" alt=""> A critical strike is a damage effect that deals 175% of its normal damage by default, denoted as critical strike damage. This can occur on some items and abilities, and almost always on basic attacks. Depending on the effect, a critical strike would occur under specific conditions, or based on critical strike chance Champions can increase their chances to critically strike and the damage they deal with critical strikes using items and abilities. Critical strikes are especially valuable for champions who deal damage primarily with basic attacks rather than abilities.

    <span class="Life_Steal/Omnivamp">
        <h1>Life Steal/Omni vamp</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Life_steal.png" alt=""> Life steal is an offensive stat which grants healing equal to a percentage of the damage dealt by basic attacks, including those that are modified It applies to abilities that deal basic damage usually those which trigger on-hit effects The damage of most item on-hit effects benefits from life steal The heal is based on the post-mitigation damage dealt, or after sources of armor, magic resistance, and damage reduction are taken into account to the damage All champions have 0% base life steal, but it can be increased by some items and abilities while omnivamp applies to all types of damaging effects and gives reduced healing to area of effect abilites.
    </span>
    <span class="Tenacity">
        <h1>Tenacity</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Tenacity.png" alt=""> Tenacity (or Crowd Control Reduction) is a stat that reduces the duration of all incoming crowd control status effects except airborne, drowsy, kinematics,nearsight, stasis, and suppression. The stat is the percentage by which the duration is reduced. The duration cannot be reduced below 0.3 − 0.625 seconds (based on when the game adds / removes the buff). The duration of the crowd control is calculated at the time of application and does not change if the tenacity changes Tenacity can be increased with champion abilities, items, and summoner spells, and also has diminishing returns.
    </span>
    <span class="Armor_pen">
        <h1>Armor Penetration/Lethality</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Armor_pen.png" alt="">Armor penetration is a champion statistic that dictates how much of the target's  armor will be ignored when the user deals physical damage. Percentage armor penetration and Lethality have no effect if the target's armor is less than or equal to 0. Armor reduction is an effect that reduces the target's armor by an amount or percentage for a period of time. Flat armor reduction can reduce the value below 0, percentage armor reduction cannot. It is important to note that penetration treats the target's resistances as being multiplied by a percentage or reduced by a flat amount, in contrast to reduction which applies to the target's resistances as a whole. All champions have 0 base armor penetration and lethality, but they can be increased with items, runes, and some champion abilities. Lethality is a champion statistic introduced in  2017 that is converted to flat armor penetration at a rate that increases based on your level.

    <span class="Magic_Penetration">
        <h1>Magic Penetration</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Magic_pen.png" alt=""> Magic penetration is a champion statistic that dictates how much of the target's magic resistance will be ignored when the user deals magic damage. Percentage magic penetration and flat magic penetration have no effect if the target's magic resistance is less than or equal to 0.

    <span class="Health_regen">
        <h1>Health Regeneration</h1>
        <img src="/Images/Health_regen.png" alt=""> Health regeneration (also known as HP5) is a stat similar to Resource regeneration which determines the amount of health a champion regenerates over a five-second period. This happens in half-second intervals. Health regeneration is considered to be a form of healing for the purposes of healing increases or decreases, and for the sake of the "Healing Done" stat at the end of game screen. Each champion starts with a certain base rate of health regeneration, which increases by a small amount at each level-up. Health regeneration can be further increased by a variety of items, abilities, and neutral buffs. Health regeneration stacks additively, and each bonus point acquired directly affects its statistic. This is true whether the bonus is a flat value or percentage-based.

        <img src="/Images/Mana_regen.png" alt=""> Resource regeneration (also known as MP5) is a stat similar to health regeneration which determines the amount of mana a champion regenerates over a five-second period. This happens in half-second intervals.Each champion that uses mana starts with a certain base rate of mana regeneration, which increases by a small amount at each level-up. Mana regeneration can be further increased by a variety of items, abilities, runes and neutral buffs. It stacks additively, and each bonus point acquired directly affects its statistic. This is true whether the bonus is a flat value or percentage-based.
